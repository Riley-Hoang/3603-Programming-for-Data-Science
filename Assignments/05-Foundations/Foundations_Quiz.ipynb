Q1. Magics

Question: What does %whos display?

Your Answer:
%whos displays all currently defined variables in the notebook, along with their type, size (if applicable), and value (or a summary for large objects).

Q2. Markdown

Question: Create a Markdown cell with a heading ## My Hobbies and a bullet list of at least 3 hobbies.

## My Hobbies
- Reading
- Cooking
- Hiking

Q3. Files and Paths

Question: Use %pwd to print your current working directory.

%pwd

Q4. File I/O

Question: Write Python code that saves "Hello World" to a file called hello.txt, then reads it back and prints the contents.

# Write to file
with open("hello.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello World")

# Read from file
with open("hello.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()
print(content)

Q5. Data I/O

Question: Load students.csv (or create a small CSV) with Pandas and show the first 5 rows.

import pandas as pd

# Example: create a small CSV if it doesn't exist
data = {"Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"], "Grade": [90, 85, 92]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_csv("students.csv", index=False)

# Load CSV and display first 5 rows
students = pd.read_csv("students.csv")
students.head()

Q6. Plotting

Question: Create a line plot of 
𝑦
=
𝑥
2
y=x
2
 for 
𝑥
x values from 0 to 10.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = x**2

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Line plot of y = x^2")
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("y")
plt.show()

Q7. Shortcuts

Question: In Command mode, what keyboard shortcut deletes a cell?

Your Answer:
Press 'D' twice (DD) to delete a cell in Command mode.

Q8. Help and Docs

Question: Use ? to display the docstring for len.

len?


This will display:

len(obj, /)
    Return the number of items in a container.

Q9. Timing

Question: Compare runtime of squaring numbers using a Python loop vs NumPy.

import numpy as np

numbers = np.arange(1_000_000)

# Python loop
def python_loop(nums):
    result = []
    for x in nums:
        result.append(x**2)
    return result

# NumPy vectorized
def numpy_square(nums):
    return nums**2

# Compare runtimes
%timeit python_loop(numbers)
%timeit numpy_square(numbers)


You will see NumPy is much faster than a Python loop.

Q10. Reflection

Question: Why is it useful to mix Markdown and code in Jupyter notebooks?

Your Answer:
Mixing Markdown and code makes notebooks easier to read and understand. Markdown allows you to explain the purpose of code, describe results, and create structured reports. This combination is useful for teaching, collaboration, and documenting analysis workflows.
