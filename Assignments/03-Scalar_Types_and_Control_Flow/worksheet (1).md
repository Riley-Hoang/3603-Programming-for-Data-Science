## 🧠 Section 1: Scalar Types

1. What is the output of the following code?

```python
x = 10
print(type(x))
```

`Answer: <class 'int'>` 

2. What scalar type would best represent:
   - A person's name: str
   - Their age: int 
   - Whether they passed a test: bool

### ✏️ Task: Type Practice

```python
# Create a variable for each type and print its value and type
# Example: an int, float, str, and bool
```
# Create a variable for each type and print its value and type

age = 18
height = 1.78
name = "Hoang"
is_student = True

print(age, type(age))
print(height, type(height))
print(name, type(name))
print(is_student, type(is_student))

18 <class 'int'>
1.78 <class 'float'>
Hoang <class 'str'>
True <class 'bool'>
